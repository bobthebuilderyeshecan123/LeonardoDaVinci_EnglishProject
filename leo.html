He was given to his grandparents who made sure he survived but gave him no love. The only person who cared about him slightly was his uncle francesco, who let him play in his large farm. From childhood, Leonardo would take drawings of everything around him. Paper was rare, but his father had a good business, which was one of the best thing his father gave him.  Not long after, his father sent him to art school because he had recognized Leonardos talent. This affected Leonardo the most and was his fathers greatest gift to him.";
